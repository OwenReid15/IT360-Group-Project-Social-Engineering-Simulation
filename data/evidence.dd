Download the Dataset //The script supports any compatible dataset; however, this dataset was used for our testing
Download the EPVME dataset directly from the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/sunknighteric/EPVME-Dataset.git

Select “Download ZIP” and save it to your machine.

Extract the ZIP File
Unzip the downloaded archive. This will create a folder containing all evidence files we used for testing.

Run the Script
When you execute the script, it will prompt you with:
Enter the evidence file path:

Provide the Full File Path
You must enter the full absolute path to the specific evidence file you want to analyze — not just the file name.

Correct example:
C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/EPVME-Dataset/EPVME/epvme_01/epvme_01.dd

Incorrect example:
epvme_01.dd

Make Sure the File Exists and You Have Permissions
If the script can’t find the file, verify the path and make sure you didn’t miss quotes or capitalization.
